# Week 1: LLM APIs, API-Key Safety & Conversation State

## Objective

Before you can build an agent, you need to be comfortable with the primitive it runs on: the LLM API call. This week is about getting that foundation completely right:  secure keys, proper response handling, and a mental model of how conversation actually works when every call starts from zero.

By the end of the week you'll have a working multi-turn chatbot and a clear picture of *why* it's built the way it is.

---

## What You'll Learn and Build

1. **Understand the API:**
   - What a `chat.completions.create` call is under the hood
   - How tokens work and what the response object actually contains
   - Why the API is stateless, and what that means for you as a builder

2. **Master API-Key Hygiene:**
   - Store your key in a `.env` file, load it with `python-dotenv`
   - Add `.env` to `.gitignore` **before** your first commit, not after
   - Never paste keys into code; rotate/revoke immediately if one leaks

3. **Understand Chat Templates:**
   - How a conversation is represented as a structured list of role-tagged messages
   - The three roles: `system` (sets behaviour), `user` (human turn), `assistant` (AI turn)
   - What a system prompt is and why it's separate from the conversation history

4. **Build Conversation State from Scratch:**
   - Maintain a `messages` list with proper role assignments
   - Resend the full history on every call (the API won't remember for you)
   - Deliberately break the history once to feel what context loss looks like

## Setup

### 1. Get a free OpenRouter API key
Sign up at <https://openrouter.ai> → Settings → API Keys → Create key.

OpenRouter gives you access to many models through one API, and the free tier is enough for this entire week. No credit card required.

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install openai python-dotenv
```

### 3. Store your key safely

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...
```

Then immediately add it to `.gitignore`:

```
.env
```

**Never** paste the key into your Python file. Not even temporarily.

### 4. The client

OpenRouter is OpenAI-API-compatible, so the `openai` SDK works out of the box, ensure that your base url is correct:

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
    api_key=os.environ["OPENROUTER_API_KEY"],
)
```

**Model we'll use:** `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash:free`

Browse all available free models at <https://openrouter.ai/collections/free-models>.

## Build Time

We recommend trying to code these out by hand (the caveman way), as writing the code != reading someone elses'

### Build 1: Single-Turn Script

A script that sends one prompt and reads the model's text from the response. The key must come from the environment, not the source file. Print out the response object, inspect all its different fields.

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
    api_key=os.environ["OPENROUTER_API_KEY"],
)

def call_model(prompt: str) -> str:
    """
    Make a single chat completion call.
    Print the full response object first and understand its structure.
    Then return just the assistant's text.
    """
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash:free",
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
        ],
    )
    # TODO: try adding a system prompt with different instructions and guidelines
    # TODO: inspect `response` before you extract anything from it
    # What's in response.choices? What's in response.usage?
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(call_model("What is the capital of Australia?"))
```

---

### Build 2: Multi-Turn Terminal Chatbot

A CLI chat loop that maintains conversation history across turns. Every call sends the *full* `messages` list, roles and all. At some point during testing, deliberately wipe the history mid-conversation and observe the model's response. That moment of confusion is the lesson.

Notice how the `messages` list mirrors what you learned about chat templates: a `system` message sets the tone, then `user` and `assistant` turns alternate.

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
    api_key=os.environ["OPENROUTER_API_KEY"],
)

def run_chatbot():
    """
    A terminal chatbot that holds a coherent multi-turn conversation.

    Your implementation should:
    - Start with a system message that sets the assistant's behaviour.
    - Maintain a `messages` list with alternating user/assistant turns.
    - Append the assistant's reply to `messages` after each call.
    - Resend the full history on every API call.
    - Allow the user to type 'exit' or 'quit' to end the session.

    Stretch:
    - Add a '/reset' command that clears history so you can feel context loss live.
    - Add a '/tokens' command that prints response.usage after the last call.
    """
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}
    ]

    print("Chat started. Type 'exit' to quit.\n")

    while True:
        # TODO: take user input
        # TODO: append the user turn to messages
        # TODO: call the API with the full messages list
        # TODO: extract the assistant's reply
        # TODO: append the assistant turn to messages
        # TODO: print the reply
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_chatbot()
```

#### Example Interaction
```
Chat started. Type 'exit' to quit.

[YOU] My name is Dave Kenney and I'm studying Electrical Engineering at IIT Delhi.
[MODEL] Nice to meet you, Arjun! What brings you to this chat?

[YOU] What's my name and where do I study?
[MODEL] Your name is Dave and you're studying Electrical Engineering at IIT Delhi.

[YOU] exit
Goodbye!
```

## High-Order Thinking: The Stateless API Problem

Some points to think about:

- **Every call is a clean slate.** The model has no memory between requests. The only "memory" it has is what you pass in the `messages` list. What happens when that list gets too long?

- **Token budgets are real.** Check `response.usage`. How many tokens did that call cost? What's your strategy when conversation history approaches the model's context limit — truncate, summarise, or drop the oldest turns?

- **Role integrity matters.** The API expects `user` and `assistant` turns to alternate after the system message. What happens if you send two `user` turns in a row? Try it and find out.

- **Context is not free.** Every token you send in history costs latency (and eventually money). What would a good eviction policy look like?

---

## Weekly Task

- Implement a simple ChatAgent class which uses the earlier `call_model` as a method. Keep this class model-agnostic, i.e. the user can use any model through it (remember we are using openrouter).
- Keep a rolling buffer that keeps only the last *N* turns. On overflow, either drop the oldest pair or summarise it into a single, short context message. Measure how this affects the model's coherence.
- Write a SUBMISSION.md file explaining how you built your chatbot, what decisions you took and why. Try to write this in your own words.

**Submit:** Your `chatbot.py` (or equivalent) implementing the multi-turn conversation loop.

**Checklist:**
- The chatbot holds a coherent conversation and uses information from earlier turns when asked.
- The user can choose from a set of models before starting the conversation.
- There is a command to exit the conversation loop
- The ChatAgent is constructed as a Python class with multiple configuration options
- The API key is loaded from the environment. A key found in source code is an auto-fail.
- A `.env` file exists and is listed in `.gitignore`.
- You do not use any external library other than openai / openrouter sdk.
- You have a SUBMISSION.md along with the code.

**Bonus:**
- Implement compaction: Automatically summarise the chat history into a single message when you hit the limit for maximum turns. Also add a manual /compact command.
- Implement [streaming](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/streaming-responses): Print tokens as they come in, rather than waiting for it to complete.

Clone this repo and start working, submission instructions will be posted soon.
